Gosh, there's so much pressure in a first post. It's as if I'll never escape the box I'm creating for myself in your mind and mine. 

I should stop there. Or, instead I'll ignore the temptation to hide behind the abbreviated exposure. Press on.

I've like lots of rally serious passion about how to cast a new dream that will become our new world. And, credibility now lost, I'll not disappoint. 

Topigraphically, I hope to stretch myself outside my assumed foundations (i.e. cold fusion's societal upheaval, VR's parallels with entheogens, Jesus, etc), but that will wait. The young don't stretch. I'll start with what I like. 

Regarding ethos, pathos, logos, and love, any and all matters of my influence and opinions should be.. now I've forgotten where I was going with that. After reflecting on the original point, and not remembering, I think now the intended influence may be achieved.

Finally, it's an honor. Thanks for listening.
